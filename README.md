# **Campaign Performance Analytics Dashboard**

Internship Project at Let’s Try | Tools: Tableau | Platforms: Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto

An interactive and insight-rich Tableau project built during my internship at Let’s Try aimed at analyzing and comparing marketing campaign performance across three major quick-commerce platforms-Swiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto.

This project highlights platform-wise performance, ROI trends, underperforming keywords and seasonal behaviors in different cities to optimize future campaigns and targeting strategies.
